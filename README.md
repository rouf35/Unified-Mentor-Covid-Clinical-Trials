COVID-19 Clinical Trials Data Analysis - Python Project

Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 clinical trials data to uncover trends and relationships between different variables. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to gain insights into the distribution of trial statuses, phases, age groups, and time-based trends.

Objectives

Handle missing data to ensure dataset accuracy.

Perform univariate analysis to understand key characteristics of individual variables.

Conduct bivariate analysis to explore relationships between different factors.

Analyze time series trends in clinical trials.

Data Analysis Steps

Handling Missing Data

Check for missing values and decide the best approach to handle them (e.g., imputation or removal).

Univariate Analysis

Status Distribution: Analyze the distribution of clinical trial statuses (e.g., Completed, Ongoing).

Phase Distribution: Examine the distribution of trial phases.

Age Group Analysis: Explore how different age groups are represented in the trials.

Bivariate Analysis

Status vs. Phases: Investigate how trial phases are distributed across different statuses.

Conditions vs. Outcome Measures: Understand the common outcome measures associated with different medical conditions.

Time Series Analysis

Analyze trends over time, such as the number of trials initiated each month.

Tools & Technologies
